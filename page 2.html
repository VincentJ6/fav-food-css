  <p class="fontsmall">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>

<div><p class="fontsmall2"> Step 1: Boil Macaroni Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni. 
  Step 2: Make a Roux While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn. 
  Step 3: Add Cheese and Macaroni Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated. Can You Bake This Mac and Cheese? This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe. To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. How to Store Mac and Cheese Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically. You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal.
